# typedtsv
Typed TSV: A simple format for typing TSVs with an implementation in Python 3.

## Why?
JSON, YAML, TOML and other simple formats aren't built for list/table like sets of data.

YAML is particularly slow due to its expansive featureset and JSON, being that is for single objects and not collections, is not chunkable.  TOML is particularly targeted towards configuration files and similarly parses results in a single dictionary object.

I once stored all PyPI package info in a YAML file and reading it back out was going to take half a day.  Using a dead-simple newline-delimited JSON format made parsing take seconds.

CSV/TSV formats have too much ambiguity resulting in repetitive custom parsing logic contained outside the file itself.

Newline-delimited JSON is convenient with little chance of making mistakes in parsing and good performance.  The downsides are types supported are a bit too limited (no int vs float), and it is also not easily human readable or editable.

## Goals
- Be simple
- Be fast
- Be easily parallelized
- Be a better alternative to CSV/TSV/JSON and simple uses of YAML

## Non-Goals
- Unlimited extensibility a la YAML
- Config files. Focus is on lists of objects/tabular data

## Format
Format is a normal TSV except the header rows uses a colon format to annotate the type:

`<col_name>:<col_type>\t<col_name2>:<coL_type2>...`

For example:

```
url:str    n_times:int   score:float
https://www.example.com 5   1.6
https://archive.org 99  9.9
```

Initial pass centered around Python's basic types plus JSON.  Current valid types are:
- int
- float
- bool      # Valid values: true, false, t, f, yes, no, y, n, 1, 0
- str       # Newlines, tabs, and backward slash must be escaped
- json

- null      # Supported for all values as 'null'.  To get literal string null, use '\\null'

Row separators use `'\n'` only.  Windows line breaks, `'\r\n'` are not valid.

**Gotcha**: In Python, you need to be careful about opening files that may contain Windows newlines:
```py
infile = open('data.ttsv', 'r', newline='\n')   # must set newline='\n' because default for newline is '\n' or '\r' or '\r\n'
```

We'll never allow quoted `'\n'` because this would make the file difficult to chunk and thus make it difficult to parallelize reading.
## TODO:
- ~~Add a boolean type~~
- ~~Add nulls~~
- Add a time type
- Maybe: support array and map types for compatibility with Postgres
